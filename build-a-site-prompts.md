# Instructions
- To start, create a repo in our GitHub org for your team. Name it the name of the prompt (e.g. Sunny Vale Daycare Center).

1. Take the prompt your team is assigned and turn it into user stories.
    - I suggest using Google Doc to make sharing these easier
2. Create gherkin scenarios to fulfill those user stories.
3. Design a UI in sync with the scenarios
- steps 2 and three can be done in parallel


# Sunny Vale Daycare Center
Sunny Vale Daycare wants to attract new parents who are very tech savvy. They want a website that allows parents to view their toddler's behavior. Daycare workers can submit reports about toddlers in their care. These reports should be short and easy to create as they have many toddlers. Workers should be able to request a meeting with the parents. Additionally, emergency contact information for evey toddler must be readily accesible for workers.

# WVU Free Stuff Marketplace
West Virgina University is located in the small town of Morgantown WV. Students make a large portion of the town and there is a lot of move-ins and move-outs as students graduate and enroll. Many students buy furniture and many students throw away furniture rather than take it with them. The WVU student council wants a website where WVU students can post items that are free for pickup by any other student. This service is only for WVU students, all students have a unique student email. Student Council members can ban students who have missues the platform. All items posted must have a picture. Contact information for student should include only their student email address. There should be functionality for searching items by description or optional tags by the poster.


# Grass Roots
Grass Roots - a landscaping company - currently tracks their jobs with a large whiteboard in the office and an Excel Spreadsheet. As the company grows, they're looking for a scalable solution to help manage their customers' requests. Grass Roots needs a web application that will allow the Admin team to schedule landscaping consultations and track their client properties. The application should include a scheduling feature that shows the available teams of landscapers and their areas of expertise (rural, urban, commercial, etc). Additionally, the individual teams of landscapers should have a dashboard in the application that shows their upcoming jobs.


# Simply Fit
Simply Fit offers personalized training tracks to help their customers achieve their desired level of fitness and health. Currently, Personal Trainers work directly with their clients, but Simply Fit is looking to expand their services to include a subscription-based web app that will allow users to create custom workouts from a selection of exercises aimed at different fitness goals. Customers can create different levels of accounts to access premium features like scheduling a 1-on-1 with a personal trainer or recording their workout metrics. 


# Aviary
Driven by their fascination with the avian form and years of dedicated research, the ornithophiles at Aviary want to create an application that bird lovers will flock to. Part field-book, part encyclopedia, Aviary aims to provide users the ability to track bird watching habits. Aviary will allow users to compile a journal of sightings, including the ability to add images and notes about the birds they discover. A premium feature will let users share their sightings on a map that the entire community will add to.
